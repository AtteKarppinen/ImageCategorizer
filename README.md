# ImageCategorizer
Summer project of Oulu University of Applied Sciences' student group. Goal is to make graphical user interface for dividing given images to different categories.

In order to run this project one needs python (we used version 3.6.3 x64), Tensorflow-cpu version and AppJar installed.
# Python
https://www.python.org/getit/
# Tensorflow:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
# AppJar
http://appjar.info/

All needed packages should be installed automatically with tensorflow but you may have to install some packages on your own.

# P.S.
With this version you can only choose one filter.
